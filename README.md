This is the R Interface to [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://onnx.ai/). ONNX is an open ecosystem that empowers AI developers
to choose the right tools as their project evolves. ONNX provides an open source format for AI models, both deep learning and traditional ML. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard
data types. Currently we focus on the capabilities needed for inferencing (scoring).

ONNX is [widely supported](http://onnx.ai/supported-tools) and can be found in many frameworks, tools, and hardware. Enabling interoperability between different frameworks and streamlining the path from research to production helps increase the speed of innovation in the AI community. 

Please visit [here](https://onnx.ai/onnx-r) for tutorials and API reference for using ONNX in R.
